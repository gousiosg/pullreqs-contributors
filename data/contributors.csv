Solutions:    Use Github to accept pull requests and track issues. They have the absolute best integration of internet ""social coding"" tools and GUI driven desktop applications. If git is not used within the organization then keep the code hosted on Github in sync with whatever is being used internally.    Acknowledge new pull requests and give an estimated time when it will be reviewed. When I see that project maintainers haven't responded to multiple issues and pull requests I assume the project is dead or that my work will be for nothing.    If there are code formatting guidelines, make sure the project maintainers have access to code formatters that can automatically reformat code submitted. Not every editor will support writing code in the exact format requested but many of them can create legible code. Most languages have tools that will reformat code to specifications so, things like ""tabs vs. spaces"" and ""end of line character(s)"" shouldn't even be an issue.    If documentation is required, require it in code comments or plain text files and generate documentation in other formats from that. I've never looked at code and wished it wasn't documented so much. I've never been upset that documentation was generated from the contents of code comments. I have been put off by projects demanding documentation in anything other than plain text or HTML. I mean, what does learning XUL, markdown, jade, less, sass, mustache, etc. have to do with anything? Now, if there's a template for docs and it's loaded into an online editor like CKEditor or a web form, that's awesome too.    Document the internal workings and intentions of the code in the project. The larger the project, the more this is needed. Nobody is going to even attempt to work on a bug if they have to parse 10,000 lines of code mentally, before being able to discover where to begin. Use a table of contents, chapters, sections, etc. and subheadings to break the doc down into logical chunks of information. A poorly formatted 10,000 line document is just as bad as undocumented code.    If the project uses a build system, do everything possible to package up all the dependencies and create a virtual machine or an installer. Barring that, write clear instructions on setting everything up and make it simple to follow. Nobody in their right mind wants to become an expert in some ancient code versioning system, custom compiler, dodgy config files, and language hacks, just to be able to build a project.    Give developers time to answer questions about the code. If a company is embracing open source and accepting contributions from strangers, it will only help them to provide support to the community which is providing free labor. I see it happen all the time: someone reports a bug and asks a few questions about the internal workings of a project, doesn't get an answer, and finds some other means of solving their own problem. Usually they solve their own problem by using a different library, project, program, etc. If there were someone answering questions in a timely fashion then perhaps the person asking would see the solution as an intellectual challenge or something simple to implement.","The biggest challenge I usually face is ungratefulness. I've never experienced that with ajaxorg but I've run into it from a couple other groups. When I come up with some solution to a bug or implement a feature that I wanted, then I share that through a pull request, I don't really need some rude response about my use of ""tabs vs spaces"" or other gripes. I'm always open to polite requests that I change things in my pull request to make it easier for devs to use and they're often easy enough to follow through with. It's when I'm being talked to like an insubordinate employee that I really lose interest in contributing. I realize that sometimes people don't know that they sound like assholes so I try to give them the benefit of doubt but, a good paper on maximizing the return on pull requests would definitely emphasize being aware of writing style and social interactions.","I'm not sure I understand the question. Something that would encourage me to submit more pull requests on the Github would be allowing projects to request them. Sort of like how Stackoverflow categorizes questions and I can pull up the list of questions I might be able to answer. . . it would be cool to have ""pull request requests"" for languages I know. I'd look through the list from time to time and have fun coding with strangers."

Either we comment on the pull request for the requester to do, but that takes time both to write comments until he actually understands and until he's done it then merge using the github interface which registers the PR as merged, or one of the main devs pulls that branch locally, does the usually 2-minute fixes himself, then merges the branch but with the disadvantage of github not registering the PR as merged, so it has to be closed manually and won't appear successful.  If we could commit the fix in the requester's branch, then push the merge button like we do within the project it would be clearer all around."

I need to see all milestones at once on a calender view, and move them around interactively. It would be handy to layout issues within a milestone on the calender as well, and assign expected man days to them."

I doubt it should be a project goal to have many contributors. It sounds great at first sight, but the quality of the work decreases.    A vcs is another barrier. It's great if you understand it, but new users are mostly just heavily confused. git adds a few layers in being technically orthogonal rather than providing intuitive primitives. (git branch does everything with branches, except switching).    In my view, pull requests add another barrier. They are a logical extension when you're in the mindset of vcses, but I see people struggle with them.","git. I can work with svn, hg, cvs, rcs, bzr, but not git. I have to look up every command every single time. In fact, it's a reason not to contribute to a project.    The second biggest challenge is the pull request itself. With hg patch queues, I frequently edit the patchfile instead of the source. pull requests are too rigid for that.    rebasing is evil in the sense that you're in a vcs, yet it is extremely simple to loose your history without hope of recovery. Isn't that weird for a vcs? mq is not much better, perhaps evolve of hg is better.  On the other hand, I do prefer mq over rebasing. mq gives much more freedom in working. rebasing means you're changing a commit in the middle of a sequence, and you're immediately stuck with all kinds of merge mess that needs to be completed before you can do the next thing. Often I jump up and down in the mq patch queue all day, below 5-7 patches that have no hope of ever getting merged (they are old versions of the change I am making, a source of previous work to copy/peak from, but not good enough to ever make in the patch that will be submitted).","Make pull requests obsolete. They are an extreme form of rigid vcs thinking. In my 5 years or so as open source developer I have hardly ever seen an open source patch that I didn't touch before committing. If wouldn't want to do that in a rebase context, at least not git-style.  Patch files are so much more flexible. I can have a bunch of them in a directory, open them with an editor, grep through the patches/changes, copy stuff out of them with the mouse, and paste it in another patch or source file (in a different clone or branch). Try doing that with commits in different branches on your local machine. (I work in an xterm and with vim, mostly; I find guis too restrictive, not powerful enough).  In that sense, what problem is a pull request solving exactly that you cannot solve with a modern patch file?    A second point is code or change re-ordening. I tend to make my changes incrementally (experimentally figuring out how to make a change), then at the end re-organize them into a neat set of patches. Obviously, the latter totally messes up the order of the changes. I would like to have a tool where I can cherry-pick changes from different patches in the queue at the same time, like having each change on a sheet of paper, first changes in a patch are all put together, spread out on a table so I can get a global view. I can take sheets and move them to other or new patches. The system handles any conflicts (I have come to think that merge conflicts mostly arise as protection to injecting changes at unexpected points in the development process. However, in a patch queue like mq, the set of patches and their order is exactly known, there are no other patches that you need protection against when working in mq. At least conflicts due to context are thus resolvable, is ny guess)."

However, it may be helpful to make the existing incentives or motivations of contributors more clear so that others can understand the different biases that are guiding a project's contributors. For example, bitcoin/bitcoin has a core team of developers with rapidly diverging incentives to collude against one another. Some are forming companies that are competitors to each other; others are being bribed with money to code certain features; others are being contacted by three-letter intelligence agencies, etc. Having an explicit representation or analysis of these incentives, or at least some way of allowing users to model out the incentives and possible scenarios, can help with understanding the general direction of a project not in terms of the technical roadmap but the socio-economic-related incentives so that users can independently evaluate how they think those incentives are shaping the roadmap or the direction of the project."
